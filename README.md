# F-LSTM_Federated_Learning_based_LSTM_Price_Prediction

Federated Learning, a distributed machine learning strategy, is used by our suggested model to enable the model to be trained on dispersed data sources. The proposed framework can learn from different devices without the need for centralized data storage thanks to federated learning, which protects the privacy of your personal information. Sensitive data is protected by remaining private and secure by only sharing model parameters (weights) with the central server.
 The proposed framework includes both Federated Learning and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Recurrent neural networks using LSTM architectures are used to forecast time-series data. Because of its propensity to capture long-term dependencies, LSTM networks are particularly useful for forecasting crytocurrencies' prices. To assess the effectiveness of our Federated Learning-based LSTM model, we ran tests. Our findings demonstrate that our suggested strategy outperforms conventional approaches and machine learning techniques by achieving a loss minimal of 2.3 * 10^{-4}. Furthermore, the proposed framework uses substantially less memory and roughly half the CPU compared to a solely centralized approach. In comparison to a centralized model, the proposed framework requires significantly less time for training and computing. The use of both Federated Learning and LSTM networks is responsible for the higher performance of our suggested model. The proposed framework can be trained on decentralized data sources via FL while maintaining data privacy, and it can recognize long-term dependencies in time-series data thanks to LSTM networks. In terms of data privacy and accuracy, our suggested model addresses the shortcomings of conventional approaches and machine learning models, and it has the potential to completely transform the field of cryptocurrency price prediction.
